I've developed a foundational understanding of GitHub, encompassing core functionalities such as repository creation, forking, branching, and managing Markdown files. I've also practiced essential version control workflows, including committing, pushing, and cloning repositories. My primary interest moving forward is to gain more insight into collaborative workflows, as this is a fundamental aspect of professional software development and a key feature of GitHub. I have also completed the Git & Github Crash Course.

I've also refreshed my Python knowledge by engaging with the assigned readings, completing quiz 1 and 2, and successfully finishing the first assignment.

I believe a dedicated, interactive session during a live lecture would be highly beneficial for learning collaborative GitHub practices. A hands-on, guided walkthrough would allow for real-time questions and clarification, which I find more effective than relying solely on asynchronous resources like textbooks, videos, and tutorials. I am a hands-on learner who thrives on direct engagement and immediate feedback.
